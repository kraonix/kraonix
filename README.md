# 👋 Hey there, I'm Sachin

🎓 Currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Applications** at *Lovely Professional University*, after completing my **Bachelor’s in Computer Applications** from *Panjab University*.

💻 While I may not have formal work experience yet, I’m actively building a strong foundation in:
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (C++)**
- **Development using Java**
- **Full-stack Web Projects (PHP, JS, HTML/CSS, SQL)**

## 🚀 What Drives Me

> *“Tech isn’t just about building things — it’s about understanding the logic behind them.”*

I'm deeply curious about how things work under the hood — whether it’s a simple loop or a full-fledged system. I love dissecting code and learning how each part contributes to the bigger picture.

## 🛠️ Projects I’m Proud Of

- **BookBounty**  
  A dynamic, role-based web platform where authors upload books, users read them, and admins manage content — built with **PHP, JS, HTML/CSS**, and **SQL** on **XAMPP**.

(…and more in progress 🚧)

## 🌏 A Bit More About Me

I’ve grown up all across India — thanks to my father’s service in the **Indian Air Force**. Constantly adapting to new places and cultures has made me flexible, fast-learning, and open-minded. I carry this adaptability into every project I take on.

✈️ In my downtime, you’ll probably find me exploring new places or geeking out over a clever algorithm.
