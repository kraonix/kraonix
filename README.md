Currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Applications from Lovely Professional University, after completing my Bachelor’s in Computer Applications from Panjab University.

While I don’t have formal work experience yet, I’m actively focused on strengthening my core in computer science — particularly Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, and development using Java. I'm driven by curiosity, especially about how things work under the hood — whether it's a simple program or a complex system.

Tech, to me, is not just about building things — it's about understanding the logic behind them.

Beyond the screen, I love traveling to new places. Having grown up in a family where my father serves in the Indian Air Force, I’ve experienced different parts of the country and learned to adapt quickly to new environments — a skill that I carry into everything I do.

I may still be early in my journey, but I make up for what I lack in experience with adaptability, curiosity, and a strong desire to keep learning.
